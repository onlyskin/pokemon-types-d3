to share:
- put in an s3 bucket and on own dowmain
- add arrow at the top (inside svg) (?)
- make bubbles hover
- potentially add a title

- make no damage ones show up

nice to have:
- optionally also add 1x type bubbles
- add left to right arrow at the top

further extensions:
- for individual pokemon
    - defensive on the left
    - if more than one type, offensive on the right
