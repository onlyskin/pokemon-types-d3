TODO
- fix window resizing bug (caused by only updating nodes if the type has changed)
- make no damage ones show up
- show the inidividual type layouts as well as what they add up to (e.g. bulbasaur show grass visualisation, poison visualisation, and combined)
- filter pokemon to the types
- load in pokedexes one by one instead of whole of national?
- extract multiple force layouts rather than one big one (?)

nice to have:
- optionally also add 1x type bubbles (toggleable)
    - Just supply as nodes to the visualisation <- the forceSimulation factory function
        should know whether 1x is included or not

further extensions:
- for individual pokemon
    - defensive on the left
    - if more than one type, offensive on the right
