TODO before release
- add text to bubbles saying 2x, 4x, ½x, ¼x, 0x

next:
- generate all 151 force vis to check they work with force params
- show the inidividual type layouts as well as what they add up to (e.g. bulbasaur show grass visualisation, poison visualisation, and combined)
- extract a force layout component
- make multiple little separate visualisatons with almost like sentences
- let user scroll through by pokedex number (or just have pokedex view with list of all pokemon in order with their little force layout)

nice to have:
- load in pokedexes one by one instead of whole of national?
- optionally also add 1x type bubbles (toggleable)
    - Just supply as nodes to the visualisation <- the forceSimulation factory function
        should know whether 1x is included or not

further extensions:
- for individual pokemon
    - defensive on the left
    - if more than one type, offensive on the right
