TODO
- extract page state/model object
- build effectiveness calculator which gets injected with the data
  - returns effectiveness data for one type or two types

- fix window resizing bug (caused by only updating nodes if the type has changed)
- make no damage ones show up

nice to have:
- optionally also add 1x type bubbles (toggleable)
    - Just supply as nodes to the visualisation <- the forceSimulation factory function
        should know whether 1x is included or not

further extensions:
- for individual pokemon
    - defensive on the left
    - if more than one type, offensive on the right
