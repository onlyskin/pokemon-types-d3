to share:
- add text at the top that appears on rollover saying 'water has 0.5x effect against fire', etc.
- make no damage ones show up

nice to have:
- optionally also add 1x type bubbles (toggleable)

further extensions:
- for individual pokemon
    - defensive on the left
    - if more than one type, offensive on the right
